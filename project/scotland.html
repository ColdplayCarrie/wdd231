        <p class="summary">Scotland was a wonderland! ...a dream destination for me! Figuring out the train from London
            to Glasgow was a breeze! The five-hour trip was filled with gorgeous scenery. Glasgow was a favorite of
            mine. The Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum was outstanding! Every Monday at 1:00 pm there is an organ
            recital on their pipe organ. Definitely worth going to! My hotel was in Glasgow and not very expensive. It
            was within walking distance to a thoroughfare of sorts that was lined with shops and food and even had
            someone busking. It was a vibe. Edinburgh is was full of people and much more touristy than Glasgow. There
            are so many things to see and do. The Royal Mile is such a fun-filled place with shops, buskers, beautiful
            old buildings, restaurants, and more. The Edinburgh Castle had amazing panoramic views of the city.
            Everything is cashless. I used Google Pay and Google Maps for everything. Check out Mary King's Close in
            Edinburgh if you ever make it there. It was so cool!</p>
